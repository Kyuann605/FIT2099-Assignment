/**
 * This module is about all the functionality specific to the Mario game we are developing.
 *
 * This module maintains track of all associated Mario game classes, packages, interfaces, enums, and abstract classes.
 *
 * There are three classes not in individual packages:
 *
 * -The Application class
 * Since the application class is a driver class that starts the programme, it should be kept separate from all other packages.
 *
 * -Utils class
 * This is due to the fact that the Utils class is a stand-alone class that is only utilised by other classes for its methods.
 *
 * -ResetManager class
 * The reset manager class used in here is tracked by this module. Reset manager class is generally singleton classes that assist to eliminate system dependencies.
