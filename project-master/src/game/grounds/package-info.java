/**
 * This module is about the grounds within the game.
 *
 * This module delves into the many types of grounds that may be found on the map.
 * Each ground has a unique role and approach to dealing with actors, and some grounds are linked to one another.
 * All grounds in this package extend the engine package's abstract ground class.
