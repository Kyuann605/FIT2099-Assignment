/**
 * This module is about the items that can be used/seen within the game.
 *
 * This module delves into the many goods available in this game.
 * Note that the Wallet class does not extend the engine package's item abstract class,
 * although the other items in this package do. Thus, Wallet is present since it still represents an item,
 * but it is not utilised in the same way that an item is used in this game,
 * it allows player to have capabilities or provides actions to actor.
